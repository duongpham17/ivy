            <h2>Acrylic</h2>
            <p>
                A great hard-wearing nail option, you can have tips to extend your nail length or even just an acrylic overlay!
                Tips extend the nail and the acrylic strengthens them, making it a great option if you have short nails or like the look and feel of strong, long nails. Everything is done custom to your preference so you can choose your preferred length and shape, if you're unsure, a member of our team would be glad to advise you! <br/>
                Natural nail acrylic overlay is when you want to keep your own nail length but strengthen them with acrylic, this is a great option if you want to keep you own nails but stronger to prevent them from breaking, snapping and tearing.

            <h2>SNS</h2>
            <p>
                If you're torn between acrylics and gel colour, why not try SNS? SNS dipping powder is thicker than gel colour but thinner than acrylics, meaning it has a strong but lightweight feel maintaining a more natural look.<br/>
                You can have tips with your SNS set for a longer look or just on your natural nails to keep it strong. This is a great in-between option for those who prefer a more natural finish but with extra strength for the nails.
                Gel colour can also be added on top of SNS for a glossy finish or you can have colour SNS where the powder is already coloured!

            <h2>Gel Polish</h2>
            <p>
            Gel polish is an incredible level-up from normal polish. Where normal polish needs to be dried for a long period of time, gel polish dries under a UV LED lamp. This means once we finish your treatment, you don't have to worry about chipping or smudging your nails, they're dry instantly and last up to 2 weeks on natural nails with care. <br/>
            You can have gel colour on your natural nails which ensures you have a long lasting manicure with no damage to your natural nails as you might experience with acrylics.<br/>
            This is a great natural nail care and the perfect option for beginners to nail treatments! Alternatively, you can have gel colour on top of acrylics as opposed to normal polish which will give you a long lasting and glossy finish with no drying time. This option is our recommendation for those having acrylics.

            <h2>Foot Care</h2>
            <p>
            Get off your feet and relax with a pedicure in our salon! During a pedicure, we file and buff the toe nails and remove the cuticles around the nail. We also remove hard skin on the heel and give it a nice buffing scrub to smooth out the soles of your feet.<br/>
            This is all done while you sit back and relax with your feet in a warm soak with a mini massage and a polish to finish off. You can also add extra minutes to your foot massage. <br/>
            If you're short for time, you can still pamper your feet with a file, buff and polish with either normal colour or gel colour!
